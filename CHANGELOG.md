## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-16

> **⚠️ Breaking change** (released as a 0.x MINOR bump per our versioning policy —
> 0.x minors may break; no `major`/`!` marker). `@collabdt/core` now owns and ships
> its own i18n messages. **Consuming apps must upgrade in lockstep:** an app that
> imports `@collabdt/core/messages` will not resolve against core < 0.3.0, and an
> app still on 0.2.x will not pick up core's strings. See Migration below.

### Added
- i18n message catalogs shipped with the package: `src/core/i18n/messages/{en,fr,es}.json`,
  exported as `coreMessages` through a new `@collabdt/core/messages` entry point.
- Build copies JSON message assets into `dist` so the catalogs ship with the package.

### Changed
- Every translation namespace used by core components (115 in `en.json`) now lives in
  core instead of the consuming app — `AppSidebar`, `Signin`, `Datasets`,
  `mapToolbarTools`, and the rest. Contributors can add a core component and its
  en/fr/es strings in a single PR, with nothing to coordinate downstream.

### Fixed
- `resetPassword` was missing its French and Spanish translations (English fallback
  only); now translated with full en/fr/es key parity.

### Migration
Merge core messages under your app catalog (app wins on key conflicts; core English
backfills any locale a key hasn't been translated into):

```ts
import { coreMessages } from '@collabdt/core/messages'
import deepmerge from 'deepmerge'

// in your next-intl getRequestConfig:
messages: deepmerge.all([
  coreMessages.en,
  coreMessages[locale] ?? {},
  appMessages, // your app-only strings, if any
])
```
